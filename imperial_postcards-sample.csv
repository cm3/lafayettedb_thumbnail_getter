Like so much else in colonial Korea, kisaeng were utterly transformed by colonial modernity…The Japanese promotion of the kisaeng as an icon of Korea was not only based on her exotic charm and erotic possibilities: it was also part of a conventional imperial strategy to rhetorically and symbolically feminize – and thereby emasculate – the colonial subject…The kisaeng represented for Japanese the Korea that most enchanted them, the authentic Korea as yet unblemished by modernity…In visual culture, the kisaeng lent her elegance and erotic glamour to enhance any setting…In essence, she represented everything many Japanese wished their Korean subjects to be"" (Atkins 2010, pp. 175-184).",,,,,Korean;,Korea;,,"Picture postcard;","CARTE POSTALE;MADE IN JAPAN;[1/2 divided back] 郵便はかき;[printed in red];",,Taisho;,,,"Ikegami Naoko;Seo-Hyun Park;",,1933-02-14,1918-03-01,,1933-02-14,,,,,"East Asia Image Collection;Imperial Postcard Collection;","Master TIF image captured at 4000 pixels across the long edge using SilverFast AI 6.6 software and an Epson v700 scanner.

"[ip0009] A Strong Porter Carrying Heavy Pot",,大力の荷運人　擔軍,[지게꾼],"460 LABOR;480 TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION;482 BURDEN CARRYING;","The ""Customs of Joseon"" postcard series tends to stereotype Koreans according to gender and class. For example, lower-class women are often found engaging in various forms of labor such as carrying water, doing laundry, and weaving, while upper-class women are in their gama (palanquin) or on an outing with ssugaechima (cloaks) over their heads. Images of lower-class males also emphasized labor, such as carrying heavy items on their jige or working as street vendors. Upper-class males were often found in their official robes (Kwon 2005, p. 261). Jige is the name of the contraption used to carry heavy items shown in the picture. It literally means ""to burden"" or ""to put burden on."" Kkun is a suffix and indicates someone who does things, usually involved in a trade of sorts. It can take on negative connotations. For example, sagikkun = swindler or noreumkkun = gambling addict. The Japanese caption 擔軍 could be a translation word for jige-kkun as kkun sounds like gun. The earliest evidence for use of jige comes from Silla-era ceramic figures. The stock phrase ""nambu-yeodae"" meaning ""men bear loads on the back, women on the head"" indicates that the gender division of labor apparent in the postcards reflected common practices (Pratt and Rutt, 1999, pp. 45-46). Unglazed earthenware and pottery with a dark brown glaze were daily essentials in most Korean households for holding soy paste, pepper paste, kimchi, water, etc., as described in Hwang Sun-weon's novel ""Old Potter"" (Cho 1996 vol. 1, p. 47).
